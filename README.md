# Pyber Analysis

## Overview

This exploratory analysis was completed to support Pyber, a ridesharing company.  They wanted to do two things as a result of this analysis:

- Improve access to their ride sharing service
- Determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods

In the following paragaraphs, I will discuss some of these findings and provide recommendations based on what the data is saying.

## Analysis

I created two charts that I will discuss in depth:

### Summary of Pyber Data

This pivot chart provides a wealth of information related to ride information and their costs.  In the first two rows we can see the total number of rides per geographic area as well as the number of drivers in these areas.  Obviously there are more drivers and more rides in the urban areas and as we move further out those numbers drop in both columns.  The total fares column provides a key metric for how the business is doing overall.  The two columns I want to focus on are the 'Average Fare per Ride' and 'Average Fare per Driver'.  These two columns get to answer the why of doing this analysis in the first place.  As you can see, the total number of rural rides only accounts for 5 percent of the total number of rides in this period but the average cost of a fare in rural areas is more than 40% higher and the average fare drivers charge is more than 300% higher than in urban areas.  With the high cost in rural areas it is easy to see why there are less riders.  This is not due to a lack of riders.  This is a cost issue.
