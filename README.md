# Pyber Analysis

## Overview

This exploratory analysis was completed to support Pyber, a ridesharing company.  They wanted to do two things as a result of this analysis:

- Improve access to their ride sharing service
- Determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods

In the following paragaraphs, I will discuss some of these findings and provide recommendations based on what the data is saying.

## Analysis

I created two charts that I will discuss in depth:

#### Summary of Pyber Data

This pivot chart provides a wealth of information related to ride information and their costs.  In the first two rows we can see the total number of rides per geographic area as well as the number of drivers in these areas.  Obviously there are more drivers and more rides in the urban areas and as we move further out those numbers drop in both columns.  The total fares column provides a key metric for how the business is doing overall.  The two columns I want to focus on are the 'Average Fare per Ride' and 'Average Fare per Driver'.  These two columns get to answer the why of doing this analysis in the first place.  As you can see, the total number of rural rides only accounts for 5 percent of the total number of rides in this period but the average cost of a fare in rural areas is more than 40% higher and the average fare drivers charge is more than 300% higher than in urban areas.  With the high cost in rural areas it is easy to see why there are less riders.  This is not due to a lack of riders.  This is a cost issue.

#### Total Fares by Week

Another intersting analysis I ran was the total amount of fares by week throughout the observed data sheet.  Through this type of analysis we can start to understand trends and behaviors behind the amount of riders we receive based on the time of the year as well as how much we earn based on social factors at the current time. Over time, we can better develop pricing in relation to these social factors and better serve our customers as well as increase our profit margins.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis I have done, I want to recommend three things:

1.  Cunduct a market analysis on fares in rural areas.  Interview as many drivers as possible to understand what contributes to their rates and how we can incentivize them to keep rates low.
2.  Understand what makes a person want to use a ride sharing service over say a friend or thier own vehicle.  Rural rides are fairly low.  What do they use ride sharing services for? What would make a prospective customer be more willing to use a ride sharing service?
3.  We need a better understanding of what is going on around the area. i.e. Sporting events, conferences, holidays, etc.  The better we understand this the better we can establish clear pricing ahead of time for our customers.
